                        Our client’s main focus was to create an app that helped craftsmen utilize their skillset to build up the local Moroccan economy via this collaborative electronic bike project. We found that:  
                        <p><strong>20%</strong> of the active Moroccan workforce are local craftsmen.</p>
                    <p><i>-Source</i></p>
                    <p><strong>77.4%</strong> of Morroco's adults are literate.</p>
                    <p><i>-Statista</i></p>
                    <p>By leveraging these insights, we aimed to design a system that facilitates efficient mobile parts assembly by creating an interface that uses minimal words and prioritizes symbolism.</p>

                    <p>There are not many apps in the current market that are addressing this need. But the overall process that our app will facilitate is similar to other freelance marketplace apps. We also analyzed various popular apps in Morocco for inspiration. Here are a couple we analyzed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Saydalia</li>
                        <li>TaskRabbit</li>
                        <li>Etsy</li>
                        <li>Tizuzaf</li>
                        <li>WhatsApp</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>CHANGE After compiling these results, we brainstormed different solutions (seen below) that current apps do not address.</p>

                    Students want to source their clothes from other students, but are concerned about the quality of the clothes and potentially create a sense of discomfort with their peers if they are dissatisfied with their purchase.
                    <div class="takeaway-number">2.</div>
                    Students’ main priority when sourcing clothes are its low cost and how fast it ships to them.

                        Building on user findings, we added an overlay that prompts users with a warning message when they swipe right on a conversation. This overlay informs users that once a conversation is deleted, it cannot be recovered, ensuring they are fully aware of the permanence of this action. This feature was implemented to prevent accidental deletions and to provide users with an additional layer of security and assurance, addressing their concerns about losing important communication history. By adding this overlay, we aim to enhance the user experience by providing clear and critical information at the moment it is needed most.</p>

We held bi-weekly meetings to ensure cohesive app flow.</p>
